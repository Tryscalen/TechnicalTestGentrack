Gentrack Techincal Test

1. I have written a c# program to take an xml file and export the data into individual csv files for each of the 200 header data
blocks with the 100 row as a header and the 900 row as a footer on each of the csv files.
The files are named as per the 200 row second coloumn
This program uses 2 class libraries one to handle the input test file and the other to handle the CSV files

2. All completed

3. Could possibly add an xml parser from a library into the mix to save manually searching through the xml file to find the 
csvinterval data tag and could refactor the program to move some other functionality to the classes to enable more reuse.
